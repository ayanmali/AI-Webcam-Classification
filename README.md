# AI-Webcam-Classification
Uses a convolutional neural network to classify an image from the webcam into one of three classes specified by the user.
Implements a GUI to allow the user to provide sample data to the model to train it on, then makes predictions on new data.

The model was created using TensorFlow and Keras, OpenCV was used for image processing, and Tkinter was used to create the GUI.

NOTE: This isn't supposed to be something super practical, ideally you would need a really big data set and clicking the buttons hundreds of times would be really tedious.
This was built more so as a fun personal project to practice building UIs and get familiar with the fundamentals of machine learning and multiclass classification,
like creating a data set, image preprocessing, building a neural network, training a model, etc. as well as build something interactive rather than just loading in a bunch of images into a folder.

Also there might be some unhandled exceptions at the moment
