# AI-Webcam-Classification
Uses a convolutional neural network to classify an image from the webcam into one of three classes
Implements a UI to allow the user to provide sample data to the model to train it on, then makes predictions on new data.

NOTE: This isn't supposed to be something practical, ideally you would need a really big data set and clicking the buttons hundreds of times would be really tedious.
This was built more so as a fun personal project to practice building UIs and get familiar with the fundamentals of machine learning and multiclass classification,
like creating a data set, building a neural network, training a model, etc. as well as build something interactive rather than just loading in a bunch of images into a folder.
